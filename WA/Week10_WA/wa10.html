            <h3>Feature Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                I created a Pokemon search function using the free Pokeapi. 
                This Api includes a ton of information on every single Pokemon in the game.
                I used it to fetch a picture of the Pokemon and its types. 
                I also included a for loop that goes through each type and creates a new div that displays it styled in the color used in the game.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation into Project</h3>
            <p>
                The way this search feature works could be very similar to 
                how the frontend of my website could talk to the backend that contained a database with quiz statistics.
                This would allow users to search for specific keywords or genres to filter.
